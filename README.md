**Lesson Plans App background:**

As a high school teacher in Calgary, Alberta (Canada), I was always annoyed at having to write plans for substitute teachers. I felt that it could be hard to structure writing a plan in a very direct way, especially when it came to showing any video resources that I only wanted to show small clips of.

So I created this Lesson Plans App to help teachers write very direct plans that can be shared with the substitute, administration, or other teachers.

**Lesson Plans App Instructions:**

Upon Sign In, the user will be shown a list of lessons that either they created or are shared with them by other teachers.

From here, the user can create a new lesson by clicking on the Create New button, or by accessing the File Menu (the graduation cap logo on the top left of the screen). 

**From the ‘create view’ page:**

- The User Menu (top right) gives the option of going to the Dashboard (the list of lessons).
- The user can create a lesson by using the Add buttons on the App Bar to add lesson resources or sections, or they can right-click and a context menu will appear giving options to add resources or sections.
- Users can add the following resources:
  - Online Pictures
  - Text
  - Online pdf documents
  - Websites
  - Youtube videos (with start and end times)
- The user can preview how the lesson looks in Read View by clicking the Preview button.
- The user can save the lesson via the File Menu
- Once a lesson is saved, it can be shared with other users

**Additional functionality:**

- Resources can be dragged and dropped to be reordered within a section
- Resources can be updated via a three-dot context menu on the top right of the resource
- Sections can be dragged and dropped to be reordered within a lesson
- From the Dashboard, the user can open, edit, delete, or share a lesson from the three-dot context menu to the right of each lesson

**Additional notes:**

I’ve saved two users: user0 (pass: user0pass) and testuser (pass: admin123), and one lesson: Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves, just as a reference
